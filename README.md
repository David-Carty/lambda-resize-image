## Description

The combination of API Gateway and Lambda is very powerful. It allows you to build some complex functionalities without maintaining any virtual machines yourself. Lambda can be hooked up to many other (AWS) Services including S3. That's why I decided to build an AWS Lambda Function to resize images automatically with API Gateway and S3 for imagemagick tasks. When an image is called on AWS S3 bucket (via API Gateway), this package will resize it and put to S3 before redirect you to the new path of this image (aws bucket url or CDN).

## Features

- Use [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless#features)
- Use [Serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)
- The image conversion endpoint by API Gateway

## Instalation

First, add Serverless globaly:

`npm install -g serverless`

Second, clone repository in your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apoca/lambda-resize-image
cd lambda-resize-image
npm install
```

Then, modify and set with your data the .env.example to env.yml (It's supposed that you already configured your [local variables](#environment-variables))

### AWS credentials

To run [local development](#local-development) you also might configure your [aws credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/installing-jssdk.html), or you can set them like showed above.

### Deploy to Amazon AWS

You also can check whether you have installed all well:

`$ serverless`

To deploy from your environment to Amazon AWS, you must:

`$ serverless deploy`

Then, serverless will packaging, validate and upload your stack to Amazon AWS, something like this:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service .zip file to S3 (1.52 KB)...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
..............
Serverless: Stack update finished...
Service Information
service: resizeS3Image
stage: development
region: eu-west-1
stack: resizeS3Image-development
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://<api_key_here>.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/development/{any+}
functions:
  handler: resizeS3Image-development-handler
Serverless: Removing old service artifacts from S3...
```

## Usage (image restrictions resize)

To restrict the dimensions, we put a `const var` in the `handle.js`:

```javascript
const ALLOWED_DIMENSIONS = {
  width: 1800,
  height: 1800
};
```

You also, can change the url endpoint `https://<api_key_here>.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/development/{any+}` to another one more tiny and cachable (cloudfront), you can also configure in you Api Gateway (lambda service) a <b>Custom Domain Name</b>.

### Example URL usage

`https://api.example.com/<KEY_S3_IMAGE_HERE>?width=<WIDTH>&height=<HEIGHT>`

## Environment variables

- URL - AWS URL S3 bucket or your CDN url to the BUCKET. (required)
- BUCKET - AWS S3 bucket. (required)

  ### Environment variables for serverless

  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS key
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS Secret

## Local development

1. `$ npm i -g serverless`
2. `$ npm i`
3. `brew install imagemagick`
4. `$ serverless offline start`

Note that you will need to have installed serverless globally. The last command (4.) will spin up an [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) version of an API Gateway, that will simulates the real one. Once running you can see all requests on your command line.

### Example request

`http://localhost:3000<YOUR_KEYNAME_TO_IMAGE>?width=<WIDTH>&height=<HEIGHT>`
